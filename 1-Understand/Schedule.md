## Example Schedule for Understand

#### Team intros *(15min)*

Introduce the design sprint team, announce the Product Owner and acknowledge the
others involved with the project but not participating in the design sprint.

#### Intro to the Design Sprint Process *(5min)*

High Level overview and goals of each day. Set expectations about how we might
feel at certain steps in the process.

There are many uses for a design sprint. At the core a design sprint is about
quickly and collaboratively using design thinking to solve problems.

#### Intro to Day 1: Understand *(5min)*

Day 1 is about developing a common understanding of the context within which we
are working and all the elements in that context (the problem, the business, the
customer, the value prop/hypothesis, success, etc). Our goal is to expose risky
knowledge gaps and identify risky assumptions so that we can make plans for
reducing those risks and move forward confident we are heading in the right
direction. Also, by gather info we will empower our decision making abilities
and eliminate the need for guesswork later on.

#### Definitions: The Business & The Customer *(1hr)*
# The Business
- Tools to facilitate students learning to code
- Tools to facilitate coaches supporting those students on their journey to becoming professional developers
- A platform linking students wishing to learn to coaches willing to coach

# The Customer

- ADMIN: Sam is a coach at Makers Academy. He is a capable developer who is excited by the opportunity to train the next generation of developers. He knows that learning to code is hard and he wants materials, tools and techniques to help his students learn at the most efficient rate they can. He is inquisitive and enjoys problem solving. As well as a strong curriculum, he wants simple communication tools that facilitate interacting with students, either individually, in pairs or in groups. He also wants as much automation as possible, especially around grading and code reviewing and progress tracking. Lastly, he is aware that different people respond to different educational formats at different times, so he would like to offer a range of options to his students - reading, videos, code alongs, walk throughts, workshops, pairing sessions, challenges, kata, projects and more. Sam has a single goal - to help people to achieve their dreams of becoming a coder. He's learnt how to do this at Makers Academy, but with it's high fees and centre-of-the-universe location, it feels out of reach to the majority of the population. He now wants to unlock the Makers course to people who, for whatever reason, aren't able to attend the Makers Academy course. He's spent the last few months teaching 8 students online in the Ronin pilot, and now he wishes to build a platform, and tools, to make this process more efficient, so that he can teach more people, and so that more coaches can come in and easily contribute to the long term vision of creating awesome junior developers.

- USER: Joe is smart, hard working, a logical thinker and enjoys solving complex problems. He has been trying to teach himself to code for months... Years even. There's just so much information out there, at times it's hard to know which tutorials to start, and which of them to finish, and in what order. On top of that, he hasn't been moving as fast as he would have liked. Carving a solid chunk of time out each week is really difficult, and when he eventually does find the time, he spends half his time relearning the stuff he learnt in the last session because it's been so long. His gut tells him that there must be a more efficient way. Lastly, coding on his own is lonely. He longs to have guidance from a developer who knows what they're talking about, as well as study-buddies to work with and to pair with. He feels that coding with other people, under the guidance of an expert, will help to motivate him, as well as help to set a pace that would be much faster than that which he would have successfully set himself otherwise. He has a single goal in mind - he wishes he could code. He knows that he's going to have to work for at least a few years before he'll be ready to build the next facebook, and he's prepared to put in the hours to achieve his dreams. The hard bit is getting a foot in the door, and he's at that point in his journey where he's actively searching for something that will improve his chances of landing a dev job in the next few months by an order of magnitude.

#### Definitions: The problem, The Value Prop, Success *(1hr)*
# The Problem
- Learning to code is hard, and coaching people along that journey is equally difficult. 

# Value Proposition
- We provide a clear, step-by-step curriculum that students can follow that will help them to get to the level of a junior developer in just 12 weeks. We provide immersion through our full-time, peer-driven course and we provide motivation through a number of techniques such as daily standups, pair programming, a community of learners, a coach and regular workshops, breakout sessions and code reviews

# Success
- HARD TO DEFINE SUCCESS METRICS... SINCE IT'S APPROXIMATING A VISION (POSSIBLE AN IMPOSSIBLE ONE) THROUGH SUCCESSIVE ITERATIONS...
- STUDENTS GET JOBS?
- COACHES LOVE THEIR JOB?
- CUSTOMERS (STUDENTS AND COACHES) ARE DELIGHTED?
