## Example Schedule for Understand

#### Team intros *(15min)*

Introduce the design sprint team, announce the Product Owner and acknowledge the
others involved with the project but not participating in the design sprint.

#### Intro to the Design Sprint Process *(5min)*

High Level overview and goals of each day. Set expectations about how we might

There are many uses for a design sprint. At the core a design sprint is about
quickly and collaboratively using design thinking to solve problems.

#### Intro to Day 1: Understand *(5min)*

Day 1 is about developing a common understanding of the context within which we
are working and all the elements in that context (the problem, the business, the
customer, the value prop/hypothesis, success, etc). Our goal is to expose risky
knowledge gaps and identify risky assumptions so that we can make plans for
reducing those risks and move forward confident we are heading in the right
direction. Also, by gather info we will empower our decision making abilities
and eliminate the need for guesswork later on.
