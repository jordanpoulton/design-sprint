Hi Imaginary Person to Whom I Write this Letter,

We're excited to start our design sprint.

To prepare for it, it would be great to have:

(1) a list of websites similar to parts of what we want to create, as well as other websites with aspects we may wish to emulate
- https://docs.google.com/a/makersacademy.com/document/d/19XvcTXkBGEUDQ9yuhcA7fthcdT2qsbjcpg2FTWf5O3A/edit?usp=sharing

(2) information about each of your key customer types: who they are, their stories, and how they feel about the problem we are working to solve. If there's documentation from interviews you conducted with them, we'd love to see that too.

* - ADMIN: Sam is a coach at Makers Academy. He is a capable developer who is excited by the opportunity to train the next generation of developers. He knows that learning to code is hard and he wants materials, tools and techniques to help his students learn at the most efficient rate they can. He is inquisitive and enjoys problem solving. As well as a strong curriculum, he wants simple communication tools that facilitate interacting with students, either individually, in pairs or in groups. He also wants as much automation as possible, especially around grading and code reviewing and progress tracking. Lastly, he is aware that different people respond to different educational formats at different times, so he would like to offer a range of options to his students - reading, videos, code alongs, walk throughts, workshops, pairing sessions, challenges, kata, projects and more. Sam has a single goal - to help people to achieve their dreams of becoming a coder. He's learnt how to do this at Makers Academy, but with it's high fees and centre-of-the-universe location, it feels out of reach to the majority of the population. He now wants to unlock the Makers course to people who, for whatever reason, aren't able to attend the Makers Academy course. He's spent the last few months teaching 8 students online in the Ronin pilot, and now he wishes to build a platform, and tools, to make this process more efficient, so that he can teach more people, and so that more coaches can come in and easily contribute to the long term vision of creating awesome junior developers.

* - USER: Joe is smart, hard working, a logical thinker and enjoys solving complex problems. He has been trying to teach himself to code for months... Years even. There's just so much information out there, at times it's hard to know which tutorials to start, and which of them to finish, and in what order. On top of that, he hasn't been moving as fast as he would have liked. Carving a solid chunk of time out each week is really difficult, and when he eventually does find the time, he spends half his time relearning the stuff he learnt in the last session because it's been so long. His gut tells him that there must be a more efficient way. Lastly, coding on his own is lonely. He longs to have guidance from a developer who knows what they're talking about, as well as study-buddies to work with and to pair with. He feels that coding with other people, under the guidance of an expert, will help to motivate him, as well as help to set a pace that would be much faster than that which he would have successfully set himself otherwise. He has a single goal in mind - he wishes he could code. He knows that he's going to have to work for at least a few years before he'll be ready to build the next facebook, and he's prepared to put in the hours to achieve his dreams. The hard bit is getting a foot in the door, and he's at that point in his journey where he's actively searching for something that will improve his chances of landing a dev job in the next few months by an order of magnitude.


(3) Any existing materials you already have on hand, such as user stories, wireframes, or prototypes. No need to flesh these out more than you already have, but they'd be great background. Note that we end up with at the end of the sprint may be different.

(5) For <date>, we'll want to schedule time with users in the morning and early afternoon. 6 users for 30 minutes each would be ideal. If you identify the people you want to bring in, we'd be happy to schedule them, or you could schedule the times directly if that's easier. We'll want to finish by 2:30pm to prepare findings for a 3:30pm discussion that day that will end the Design Sprint. We'll have each participant use the prototype we built and ask them questions to get their feedback.

- CURRENT RONIN STUDENTS as Users
- Sam Morgan and Sam Joseph as Coaches

See you soon. Thanks,
