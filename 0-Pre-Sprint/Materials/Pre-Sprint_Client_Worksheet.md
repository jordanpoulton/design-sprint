Dear RONIN,

Thank you for choosing thoughtbot, inc. to help you develop your product! We are excited to work with you and your team to help your business successfully grow. In order to achieve this goal, we are kicking off the project with the 5-day Product Design Sprint, a process advertised by  Google Ventures, to better understand how we can work together to create a successful product. 

Before we start the design sprint, it is important to gather important research materials to save us time during the week. Please come prepared with the relevant information below! 

Please identify five (5) users we can test at 30-minute-intervals during Day 5: Validation.

* 1. ADMIN - Sam Morgan
* 2. ADMIN - Sam Joseph
* 3. USER - Joe Knowles
* 4. USER - Dan Blakeman
* 5. USER - Gus Markevicius
* 6. USER - for good luck, Ilya Faybisovich

Please identify at least three (3) websites that are competitors/similar to your idea.

* 1. https://dash.generalassemb.ly/projects
* 2. http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta/
* 3. http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/

Please conduct at least three(3) customer interviews.

* Who are the customers?
* - ADMIN: Sam is a coach at Makers Academy. He is a capable developer who is excited by the opportunity to train the next generation of developers. He knows that learning to code is hard and he wants materials, tools and techniques to help his students learn at the most efficient rate they can. He is inquisitive and enjoys problem solving. As well as a strong curriculum, he wants simple communication tools that facilitate interacting with students, either individually, in pairs or in groups. He also wants as much automation as possible, especially around grading and code reviewing and progress tracking. Lastly, he is aware that different people respond to different educational formats at different times, so he would like to offer a range of options to his students - reading, videos, code alongs, walk throughts, workshops, pairing sessions, challenges, kata, projects and more. Sam has a single goal - to help people to achieve their dreams of becoming a coder. He's learnt how to do this at Makers Academy, but with it's high fees and centre-of-the-universe location, it feels out of reach to the majority of the population. He now wants to unlock the Makers course to people who, for whatever reason, aren't able to attend the Makers Academy course. He's spent the last few months teaching 8 students online in the Ronin pilot, and now he wishes to build a platform, and tools, to make this process more efficient, so that he can teach more people, and so that more coaches can come in and easily contribute to the long term vision of creating awesome junior developers.

* - USER: Joe is smart, hard working, a logical thinker and enjoys solving complex problems. He has been trying to teach himself to code for months... Years even. There's just so much information out there, at times it's hard to know which tutorials to start, and which of them to finish, and in what order. On top of that, he hasn't been moving as fast as he would have liked. Carving a solid chunk of time out each week is really difficult, and when he eventually does find the time, he spends half his time relearning the stuff he learnt in the last session because it's been so long. His gut tells him that there must be a more efficient way. Lastly, coding on his own is lonely. He longs to have guidance from a developer who knows what they're talking about, as well as study-buddies to work with and to pair with. He feels that coding with other people, under the guidance of an expert, will help to motivate him, as well as help to set a pace that would be much faster than that which he would have successfully set himself otherwise. He has a single goal in mind - he wishes he could code. He knows that he's going to have to work for at least a few years before he'll be ready to build the next facebook, and he's prepared to put in the hours to achieve his dreams. The hard bit is getting a foot in the door, and he's at that point in his journey where he's actively searching for something that will improve his chances of landing a dev job in the next few months by an order of magnitude.



Thank you for preparing these materials. If you can, please send these materials prior to the design sprint to the designers. We look forward to working with you on ___!
